      Characteristics of Dataset
      ==========================

The files for the dataset represent a individual trial performed by a subject wearing 
a wireless batteryless sensor. Each trial consists of the performance of scripted ADL. 
The files are anonymized; however, indication of the gender of the participant is 
indicated at the end of the file name.

The content of the file is as follows:
Comma separated values (CSV) format.
Column 1: Time in seconds starting from 0 rounded to the closest 0.025s
Column 2: Acceleration reading in G for frontal axis
Column 3: Acceleration reading in G for vertical axis
Column 4: Acceleration reading in G for lateral axis
Column 5: Id of antenna reading sensor
Column 6: Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) 
Column 7: Phase
Column 8: Frequency
Column 9: Label of activity, 1: sit on bed, 2: sit on chair, 3: lying, 4: ambulating
